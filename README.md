# Tweet Reader

An Android app that reads tweets from a specific account.

## Flavours

* Bolsonaro

Current president of Brazil. Like Donald Trump, extremely hated by 
the establishment media, artists, feminists, academia, most 
big companies and the left in general for having a different 
opinion. 

Always gets called a bigot, racist, homophobe, nazi, fascist, 
sexist, etc.

* Joaquin Teixeira

A Brazilian retired man with very conservative views towards
life in general. His account always gets blocked on Twitter
and other social media for 'hate speech' when he simply
makes fun of feminists and other hysteric far-left activists.

* Paul Joseph Watson

A British conservative who always exposes the far-left,
especially on YouTube.

All his videos are demonetised and sometimes censored by 
YouTube right when they are uploaded because of 'hate speech' 
when all he does is criticise and expose the far-left agenda 
and their hypocrisy. Meanwhile youtubers who openly support 
terror attacks and other hateful and extremist opinions 
continue to have their videos monetised.

## Suspension

Since these accounts belong to conservatives and Twitter, like
the establishment media and the rest of the Silicon Valley,
is against free speech, this app is prepared to handle cases
when an account is suspended.
