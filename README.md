# Tweet Reader

An Android app that reads tweets from a specific account.

## Flavours

* Bolsonaro

Current president of Brazil. Like Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro is 
extremely hated by the establishment media, artists, feminists, 
academia, most big companies and the left in general for having a 
different opinion. 

Always gets called a bigot, racist, homophobe, nazi, fascist, 
sexist, etc.

* Joaquin Teixeira

A Brazilian retired man with very conservative views towards
life in general. His account always gets blocked on Twitter
and other social media for 'hate speech' when he simply
makes fun of feminists and other hysteric far-left activists.

* Paul Joseph Watson

A British conservative who always exposes the far-left,
especially on YouTube.

Most, if not all of his videos are demonetised and sometimes 
censored by YouTube right when they are uploaded because of 
'hate speech' when all he does is criticise and expose the 
far-left agenda and their hypocrisy. Meanwhile youtubers who 
openly support terror attacks and other hateful and extremist 
opinions continue to have their videos monetised.

* Trump

The current US president. Just like any conservative who won't
bow down to leftist ideas, Donald Trump is always targeted by
the mainstream media, universities, the deep state, big companies,
feminists and other leftists in general.

Trump has a firm attitude towards crime, terrorism and illegal
immigration, which is one of the main reasons why the left hates
him so much.

## Suspension

Since these accounts belong to conservatives and Twitter, like
the establishment media and the rest of the Silicon Valley,
is against free speech, this app is prepared to handle cases
when an account is suspended.
